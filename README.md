# Movie API

## Project Overview: 

This is the server-side component of a "movies" application that gives users access to information about different movies, their directors and genres. After signing up, users will be able to update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies. 
It is part of two larger projects, one of them built with the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), the other one with the MEAN tech stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js).

## Key Features: 

- Return a list of all movies to the user
- Return data about a single movie by title
- Return data about a genre by name
- Return data about a director by name
- Allow users to register
- Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth)
- Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites
- Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites
- Allow users to delete their account
